-- Players - Bootstrap Data
-- This file is intentionally minimal. All scraped players are created
-- by per-league SQL generators during `make load`.
--
-- ARCHITECTURE: Auto-gen IDs. One player per person (UNIQUE person_id).
-- Player sources tracked in player_sources table (multi-source).
--
-- Previously this file contained 7,151 exported players with hardcoded IDs.
-- That approach caused ID collisions across leagues.
-- Now all player data flows through the per-league parse pipeline.
