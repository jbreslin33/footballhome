-- Roster Pools - Shared roster configurations (CASA-style)
-- Teams in the same roster_pool can share players freely
-- NULL roster_pool_id = no sharing (hierarchical only, APSL-style)
-- Same roster_pool_id = peer sharing enabled (CASA-style)

-- This file is intentionally empty initially
-- Roster pools are created as needed when clubs configure shared rosters
-- Examples will be added via -m (manual), -u (dev), or -p (prod) files
