-- Cross-League Data Curation
-- Purpose: Manual fixes for duplicates, merges, and associations across ALL leagues/countries
-- This runs AFTER all 042-* bootstrap files have loaded raw scraped data
--
-- Philosophy: Bootstrap data (042-*) is "dumb" - trust the HTML source
--             Curation (043) is "smart" - human knowledge fixes duplicates
--
-- Common fixes:
-- - Merge duplicate clubs that appear in multiple leagues/countries
-- - Fix organization hierarchy (assign clubs to parent orgs)
-- - Correct team names and associations
-- - Delete obvious data quality issues
--
-- Examples:
-- -- Same club plays in multiple US leagues
-- UPDATE teams SET club_id = 100 WHERE name = 'Lighthouse 1893 SC' AND club_id IN (101, 102, 103);
-- DELETE FROM clubs WHERE id IN (101, 102, 103); -- Merge to id=100
--
-- -- Fix org hierarchy
-- UPDATE clubs SET organization_id = 10 WHERE name LIKE 'New York Cosmos%';
--
-- -- Delete specific orphan we know is a duplicate
-- DELETE FROM clubs WHERE id = 456 AND name = 'Central Park Rangers 1999'; -- Duplicate of id=50

-- Add your manual curation SQL here
-- Keep this file for human decisions only - no automation
