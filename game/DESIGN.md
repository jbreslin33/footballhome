## 1. What this is

A server-authoritative 3D 11v11 soccer game, playable in a browser (and later
any client), with human control of one or more players and AI control of the
rest — built as a teaching tool for real tactical knowledge, from youth to
world-cup level, and open enough to also run as a management game
(Football-Manager-style: humans set tactics, AI plays) and to decompose into
small-sided scenarios (4v4, 2v1, coach-painted drills).

## 2. Pillars (every slice is judged against these)

1. **Open system.** The engine knows physics and perception. Everything that
   constitutes soccer knowledge — attributes, behaviors, formations, tactics,
   scenarios, rules flags, level bands, copy — is data: DB registry rows and
   parameterized components, changed by migration, never by engine edits.
2. **Server-authoritative.** All game state is computed server-side in C++.
   Clients send intents and render snapshots. Zero game logic client-side;
   client prediction/smoothing is cosmetic only.
3. **Deterministic fixed point.** No floats in the sim loop. Same seed + same
   inputs = byte-identical results across architectures, locked by replay
   goldens. This is what makes permanent refactoring safe.
4. **Protocol-first.** The versioned binary wire protocol (`game/PROTOCOL.md`)
   is the product boundary. Browser, native phone, desktop C++, and headless
   clients (calibration, AI stand-ins, spectator, replay) all interoperate by
   speaking it. Clients can be built by anyone, any time, without server
   changes.
5. **Realism by calibration, not vibes.** A headless calibration harness
   simulates batches of matches and asserts statistics against real-world
   anchors (~2.7 goals/game at top level, pass-completion % by level, shot
   counts, possession splits). Once live, those assertions are CI gates: a
   change that makes the game arcadey fails the build. Anti-FIFA by
   construction.

## 3. Non-negotiables (carried from v1 — decisions, not code)

- Gameplay math is fixed point; floats never enter the sim loop.
- Binary wire format; JSON only on human-facing debug surfaces.
- Every slice lands green: containerized test suite passes before commit.
- New registry attributes/concepts arrive by migration + regenerated header +
  consistency check against the live DB.
- Determinism goldens accumulate; a golden never silently changes value.
- **Slot-count agnosticism (new):** every component must work at any team
  size. A small-sided `MatchScenario` config (3v3) keeps its own determinism
  golden in CI from day one — if a feature only works at 22 slots, the build
  fails. This is what keeps 4v4/2v1/painted drills free forever.

## 4. Architecture

                                                 engine, same DB
```

- **3D scope:** the ball gets a z-axis (lofted passes, bounces, headers);
  player locomotion is planar. The browser client renders with WebGL
  (Three.js); fidelity is client-local dressing over the same authoritative
  positions.
- **Sim speed is a server parameter**, decoupled from wall clock: 1× live,
  N× fast-forward, headless max-speed. Required by the calibration harness
  and by manager mode; trivial under determinism.
- **Match lifecycle:** per-match daemons orchestrated like v1 (container per
  match, reaper), reachable via nginx WebSocket proxy with runtime DNS
  resolution (variable `proxy_pass` — the v1 pattern that resolves at request
  time, never startup).
- **Club integration (not optional — the point).** The game runs on the club
  app's own data: game profiles key on `persons.id` (your real squad are the
  characters, at their real levels); teams/rosters/formations are the club's
  existing rows; auth is the club's JWTs, so magic links drop a player into
  the game as themselves with zero signup (v1 proved this end to end). FM
  mode manages real club teams and fixtures; painted scenarios attach to a
  real person; training/attendance can feed attribute growth over time.

## 5. AI — three layers, hand-authored, data-driven

1. **Team layer** — tactic state (press high / mid-block / counter / hold),
   ball-relative formation targets (HELIOS-style interpolation: home position
   = f(formation, ball position)). Coaching knowledge lives here as DB rows.
2. **Role/unit layer** — responsibilities within the tactic: cover shadows,
   press partners, support spots, marking assignments, third-man runs.
3. **Player layer** — utility-scored behavior bags (v1's model), filtered by
   **skill-scaled perception/decision/execution noise**. Level (youth →
   world cup) = attribute distribution + noise scale. One knob, not twelve
   codepaths.

### 5.1 Technique inventory & the history ladder [FH]

- **Techniques by layer** (what "utility AI" concretely means here):
  team layer = finite state machine over tactic states [Buckland's team
  states]; role layer = cost-minimizing assignment (who presses / covers /
  outlets) [HELIOS marking]; player layer = utility-scored behavior bags
  with hysteresis [v1], executed through steering behaviors (seek / arrive /
  pursue / interpose) [Reynolds via Buckland]. G2 ships the primitive form:
  steering + a priority rule list + linear formation shift; each upgrade
  replaces a piece in place. Next majors: [Buckland]'s support-spot
  calculator (the passing game's heart) + his messaging pattern for
  coordination; [HELIOS] Delaunay formations; someday [HELIOS] chain-action
  search for pass sequences. [GRF]'s rule-based 11v11 is the sanity
  benchmark.
- **Tactics are implanted, not evolved.** Mechanics must land in dependency
  order — which IS soccer's historical order (no passing game without a
  pass, no WM without positions, no gegenpress without press triggers) —
  but tactical knowledge arrives off-the-shelf as registry data, never
  rediscovered by self-play (§5's no-RL charter).
- **The history ladder = the level ladder [FH].** U-8 swarm ball IS 1860s
  soccer; positional U-12 is the 1900s; a pressing high-school side is the
  1980s; pro positional play is the 2020s. Levels therefore combine
  attribute/noise scaling with TACTICAL ERA, and a campaign through soccer
  history ("beat the pyramid", "break catenaccio", "escape the gegenpress")
  is a coaching curriculum disguised as a game — teaching content for free.

### 5.2 Rated tactical understanding — the knowledge triple [v1]

Tactical intelligence is per-player DATA in three registries (v1 built all
three: attribute registry, concept registry, PatternRegistry +
RecognitionSystem — v2 inherits the model):

1. **Recognition** — *can you see it?* Named patterns are computed from
   world state (e.g. `high_line`: opponents' rear line x + space behind);
   a player's recognition rating decides IF and HOW EARLY their brain is
   told the pattern fired.
2. **Concept** — *do you know the answer?* Concepts gate which behaviors
   are in a player's bag (`play_over_the_top` responds to `high_line`).
3. **Execution** — *can you pull it off?* The kick/control attributes +
   skill noise decide whether the answer comes off.

"Sees the high line and plays over it" = three separately rated, separately
trainable rows — so every failure is diagnosable (didn't see / didn't know /
didn't execute), which is the teaching thesis in one sentence. Second worked
example: `deep_block` + `ball_side_overload` recognitions → `switch_play`
concept (v1's SwitchSideSupportBehavior is already implemented + tested in
the archive's seven unwired behaviors) → long cross-field pass execution.
The pattern vocabulary grows as registry rows: `pressing_trap`, `keeper_off_
line`, `third_man_free`, … — each one a lesson a coach can rate and train. Tactical
eras (§5.1) are level-band bundles of concepts + recognitions; painted
scenarios can target one pattern; training/attendance raises specific rows.

**No neural nets / RL for players** — opaque, non-deterministic,
unteachable. ML is permitted only offline: optimizing utility weights against
the calibration harness, with the resulting numbers committed as data.
Every decision must be inspectable ("jockey scored 0.8 because lateral
dribble + positioning_sense 72") — that inspectability IS the teaching tool.

## 6. Manager mode (FM-style) — day-one hooks, later milestone

The protocol defines **two intent classes from the start**: player intents
(move/pass/shoot/switch) and **tactical intents** (set formation, make sub,
change role instruction, set tactic state). A manager client is an ordinary
protocol speaker that only sends tactical intents and watches — at 1× or
fast-forwarded. A match with zero player-clients is AI vs AI, which is also
exactly what the calibration harness runs. The career meta-game (seasons,
transfers, training-driven attribute growth) is a separate layer over the
same DB registries and never touches the match engine.

## 7. Clients

- **v2.0 client: browser**, Three.js/WebGL, barebones polygon players.
  Phone-first: virtual joystick + pass/shoot/press buttons + tap-to-switch,
  broadcast-angle camera legible on a 6" screen. Touch controls and camera
  are named milestones, not afterthoughts.
- Snapshot budget ~15–25 KB/s (22 slots + 3D ball at 20–30 Hz) — fine on LTE.
- Later, without server changes: realistic desktop C++ client, native apps,
  WASM build of the fixed-point core for offline solo practice.

## 8. Milestones

| # | Adds | Exit gate (playability checkpoint) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **G0** | Protocol v1 handshake + intents/snapshots; fixed-point core (port Fixed64/FixedMath/TrigLUT concepts from v1); tick loop; WebSocket server; `make game-deploy` container test gate; Three.js client: pitch + one movable player | **You move a player around a 3D pitch from your phone.** Walking skeleton — every later slice lands inside it | **done** (10/21) |
| **G1** | 3D ball: dribble, ground pass, lofted kick, bounce; goal detection; first determinism goldens | **Kickabout**: dribble and shoot on a goal; two humans pass | **done** (10/21) |
| **G2** | Parameterized `MatchScenario`; formation anchoring; team possession state; utility-AI roles; calibration harness v0 (headless client, max-speed); standing 3v3 golden | **Playable 3v3 vs AI** — first real game | **done** (10/21) |

| **G4** | Calibration CI gates live; level bands (youth→world cup) via attribute distributions + noise scaling; touch-control + camera polish | Realistic, level-aware 11v11 that fails CI if it goes arcadey | **in progress** (G4.1-G4.14; CI gate LIVE) |
| **G5** | Manager mode v0: tactical intents live (subs, formation, tactic state); fast-forward; AI-vs-AI spectating | **Watch your lineup play your tactic, FM-style** | not started |
| **G6+** | Drills as `MatchScenario` configs (2v1, 4v2 press…); coach-painted scenarios; replay viewer; desktop client; WASM offline | Teaching library + client family | not started |

v1 shipped its first four milestones in ~17 days of sessions against a
15–20-week estimate; G0–G3 at that cadence is realistically a few weeks of
sessions. Slices get specced per-milestone as work opens (v1 style: numbered
slices, exit gates, goldens).

### 8.1 G0 slices

- G0.1 [x] (2026-10-21) Scaffolding + fixed-point math core **adopted verbatim from v1
  after review** (`Fixed64`, `FixedMath`, `TrigLUT`, `RngDet`, `Vec3` + their
  golden tests — knowledge-free, dimension-agnostic infrastructure; adopting
  a vetted library is not carrying old architecture). `game/CMakeLists.txt`,
  tests green on host. Landed: namespace `fh::game::math`, 5/5 ctests passed
  (fixed64, fixed_math, trig_lut, rng_det, vec3) on g++ 13 / CMake 3.28.
- G0.2 [x] (2026-10-21) Tick loop + match clock + world skeleton (slot-count
  agnostic `World` integrating sampled MoveIntents; desire clamped to unit
  length so a hostile client can't outrun max_speed) + byte-order-stable
  FNV-1a canonical hash + **first determinism golden** locked at
  `0xba2dc29b0b1bbb1a` (4 players, seeded intents, 400 ticks, seed 42).
  8/8 ctests green.
- G0.3 [x] (2026-10-21) Protocol framing: envelope codec + HELLO/GOODBYE/
  PLAYER_INTENT/SNAPSHOT/CLAIM encode/decode (`fh::game::net`), total-function
  decoders (truncation-safe, trailing-bytes-tolerant per §9). PROTOCOL.md
  §1/§4/§6 layouts locked in the same slice; players carry no z on the wire
  (planar — ball gets z in G1), 22-player snapshot ≈ 730 B ≈ 22 KB/s @ 30 Hz.
  9/9 ctests green.
- G0.4 [x] (2026-10-21) WebSocket server + daemon. [v1]'s RFC 6455 stack
  (frame codec, handshake, poll(2) transport) + HMAC-SHA256 JwtVerifier
  adopted, subprotocol rebranded `fh-game.v1.bearer.<JWT>`. New
  `fh::game::server::GameServer`: HELLO on connect, first-claim-wins slots
  (one client may hold several — "control 1 or more players"), intents
  authorized against slot ownership (the frame's slot field is a request,
  never a fact), snapshot fan-out each tick. `fh-game` daemon binary:
  env-configured, wall-clock pacing outside the sim (GAME_SPEED=0 = headless
  free-run for calibration/FM). 14/14 ctests. Dockerfile moved to G0.5
  where the container gate lands.
- G0.5 [x] (2026-10-21) Container gate: two-stage `game/Dockerfile` ([v1]
  pattern — lint gates `check_no_floats`/`check_no_bad_rng` + Release build
  + full ctest INSIDE the image build, so a failing test fails the build and
  a bad image cannot exist). Runtime stage: slim, non-root, binary + libssl.
  `make game-deploy` (compose build) + `make game-test` (fast host loop).
  First image built clean.
- G0.6 [x] (2026-10-21) nginx `/game` proxy (variable upstream + resolver =
  request-time DNS, so nginx starts with the daemon down — the old /sim
  literal-host footgun avoided) + `footballhome_game` compose service.
  Deployed; the retired sim container was removed in the same deploy.
- G0.7 [x] (2026-10-21) Browser client: `game.html` + `js/game/` (wire
  codec via DataView/BigInt, WS subprotocol auth reusing the club session
  token, Three.js broadcast-camera pitch, 100 ms snapshot interpolation
  [QUAKE], tap-to-claim, WASD + anchored virtual joystick). JwtVerifier
  extended to the club backend's real claim shape (`userId` as JSON string
  = users.id; users.id → persons.id mapping lands with G2's DB layer).
  G0 spawn: two facing team lines via `World::placePlayer` (golden
  unaffected — its world never places).
- G0.8 [~] Exit gate verified end-to-end on DESKTOP against live
  footballhome.org (2026-10-21): claim → drive → 17.0 m east at exactly
  6 m/s, server-computed, through host nginx + container nginx + daemon
  with a real club JWT. 14/14 ctests green, golden intact. **Remaining:
  James's phone test, then tick this box.**

### 8.2 G1 slices — the ball

- G1.1 [x] (2026-10-21) 3D ball in `core`: gravity + ground bounce (restitution) on z,
  [v1]'s multiplicative roll decay + snap-to-rest + kick-alive runway on the
  ground plane (constants re-derived for 30 Hz), arcade boundary walls at
  the pitch edges ([FH] placeholder until G3 restarts replace them —
  kickabout must not lose the ball). World gains pitch dims + the ball;
  canonical hash extends to ball state; **golden re-locked once, here**.
- G1.2 [x] (2026-10-21) Possession: automatic first-touch capture (slow ball within
  [v1] control radius 0.5 m, nearest wins, lower slot breaks ties), glue
  carry 0.4 m ahead of movement, no stealing yet (press arrives G2).
- G1.3 [x] (2026-10-21) Kick actions via the intent `action` field (1 = ground kick,
  2 = lofted kick; direction = move vector, else carry direction; preset
  powers). Actions latch until consumed by the next tick. Goal detection:
  mouth AABBs at x = ±half_x (7.32 × 2.44 m), goal → event + kickoff reset.
- G1.4 [x] (2026-10-21) Wire 1.1 shipped end to end: SNAPSHOT ball tail,
  EVENT goal frames; client renders ball + goal frames, Space/PASS and
  X/LOFT kick controls (keyboard + touch buttons), goal flash + running
  score from server events only.
- G1.5 [~] Exit gate verified on DESKTOP against live footballhome.org
  (2026-10-21): claimed #6, ran onto the loose ball, auto-captured, glue
  dribble, lofted chip (flight apex 1.74 m), ball outran the chase, rolled
  in — server GOAL event, "GOAL! 1 — 0", kickoff reset. **Remaining:
  phone kickabout (ideally 2 humans passing), then tick.**
- Known gap logged during verification: PLAYERS have no pitch bounds (the
  scorer chased the ball straight off the grass). Fine for G1 arcade walls
  era; G2's formation/positioning work should clamp player positions to
  pitch + margin.

### 8.3 G2 slices — shape and brains

- G2.1 [x] (2026-10-21) Player pitch bounds (clamp to pitch + 2 m margin — the G1 live
  test watched a scorer sprint into the void). Changes the state surface →
  golden re-lock batched with G2.2's.
- G2.2 [x] (2026-10-21) Formations as data-shaped specs: per-team-size base positions
  (11 = 4-4-2, 3 = 1-1-1, generic lines otherwise) + ball-relative anchor
  shift ([HELIOS]-lite: translate the shape toward the ball, clamped;
  the full Delaunay interpolation and the DB formation registry with
  [v1]-style migration→codegen land in their own slice before G3 closes —
  in-code specs are an explicit, documented stopgap).
- G2.3 [x] (2026-10-21) Team setup (World::setTeam) + possession state (ours / theirs / loose, from ball
  owner's team) feeding the AI.
- G2.4 [x] (2026-10-21) First AI brains for every un-claimed slot, deterministic and
  pure ([FH]/[Buckland]-lite utility): hold shifted anchor; nearest to a
  loose ball chases; nearest presses an opposing carrier; an AI carrier
  dribbles at goal and shoots inside 22 m (aim = goal centre, kick = the
  existing action path). Humans always override by claiming; released
  slots revert to AI.
- G2.5 [x] (2026-10-21) Calibration harness v0 [FH]: `fh-game-calibrate` headless tool —
  N AI-vs-AI matches at free-run speed, prints goals/game + possession
  split; ctest sanity gate (a match completes; goals in a sane band).
  Protocol-speaking harness replaces it when orchestration lands.
- G2.6 [x] (2026-10-21) Standing 3v3 golden (slot-count agnosticism enforced in CI) +
  11v11 AI-match golden; client Q-key cycles held players.

**G2 calibration log (the harness earning its keep on day one):** run 1
caught chasers stopping 1.5 m from a 0.5 m-capture ball (100% loose);
run 2 caught kicks being unreceivable (capture cap 8 < kick 14 — raised to
20: receiving and intercepting became the same mechanic); run 3 exposed
shot-stutter self-recapture (fixed: 0.5 s kicker lockout) and that pressing
without STEALING is cosmetic (one-sided 160–0 cycles) — touch-to-steal
[v1 contest lineage] added (0.6 m, 10 ticks); runs 4–5 showed kick-under-
pressure degenerates to ping-pong (50–79% loose) — carriers carry, steals
supply turnovers. Shipped level: symmetric 112–91, possession 40/38/20,
saves + steals + end-to-end play. ~203 goals/game vs the ~2.7 anchor is
G4's job (GK hands, passing, shot noise, touch quality all precede tuning).

### 8.4 G3 slices — a real match

- G3.1 [x] (2026-10-21) MatchEvent generalization (Goal / ThrowIn / GoalKick / Corner /
  Kickoff / HalfTime / FullTime, each with a team) replacing the bare
  GoalEvent; wire EVENT ids assigned once in PROTOCOL.md.
- G3.2 [x] (2026-10-21) Restarts replace the arcade walls: last-touch tracking; side
  line → throw-in at the crossing point (other team); end line outside the
  mouth → corner (attackers, nearest corner) or goal kick (defenders);
  goal → kickoff awarded to conceders. A restart places a DEAD ball only
  the awarded team may first-capture; AI opponents hold anchors instead of
  crowding it (no hands/thrower animation — a throw-in is a kick in v0,
  documented). NO offside, NO fouls (charter).
- G3.3 [x] (2026-10-21) Score, match clock, halves in World (period 1/2, configurable
  half length, kickoff alternates; no side swap in v0 — documented);
  FullTime → score/clock reset + restart (match 1 is a perpetual sandbox).
  State surface grows → goldens re-locked once, batched here.
- G3.4 [x] (2026-10-21) Wire 1.2: SNAPSHOT appends score/period/clock/restart-team
  (additive); client scoreboard (score + mm:ss + period), restart/goal
  status toasts, AUTO toggle (auto-switch active to held player nearest
  the ball) + Q-cycle kept.
- G3.5 [~] Exit gate verified on DESKTOP (2026-10-21): live sandbox match
  on footballhome.org with running scoreboard (watched 1-0 become 1-1),
  "Kickoff — away" toast after the goal, dead-ball restarts in the 1.2
  snapshots; 5-minute halves (GAME_HALF_MINUTES). Calibration with
  restarts: symmetric 146-145, possession 33/32/34, 10-min sanity = 27
  goals (band holds). **Remaining: James plays a timed match on his
  phone, then tick.** Goldens re-locked for the G3 surface (history in
  test_determinism_core).

### 8.5 G4 slices — the passing game & toward realism

- G4.1 [x] (2026-10-21) The passing game [Buckland]-lite: carrier evaluates
  forward receivers (progress-scored, 5–30 m window, 2 m lane check via
  point-segment distance), passes when pressed or when the gain is big;
  ShortPass action (8 m/s) inside 14 m, driven ball beyond; loft-clear only
  when touch-tight with no outlet. One support teammate (nearest to the
  carrier) runs a chosen-side spot 12 m ahead ([Buckland] support-spot
  sampler replaces this). **Calibration: 291 → 10.0 goals/game (5–5
  symmetric), 10-min sanity 3 goals** — the single biggest realism jump so
  far; the 1860s→1890s transition on the §5.1 ladder. AI goldens re-locked.
  Note: "possession %" now undercounts (pass flight counts as loose) —
  attribute in-flight ball to last-touch team in a later metrics slice.
- G4.2a [x] (2026-10-21) Formations from the CLUB's own `formations` table
  — no new tables, no migration: the lineup picker's positions_json rows
  ARE the AI shapes (Postgres expands the JSON server-side; the daemon
  never parses JSON). Boot-time load only, loud FALLBACK to built-ins when
  the DB is down (goldens/tests use built-ins, never the DB). Compose:
  GAME_FORMATION_HOME=4-4-2 / AWAY=4-3-3 + explicit POSTGRES_* (password
  matches the db service, not the env file). Live: home plays the club's
  4-4-2, away its 4-3-3; a formation added on the club page is instantly
  a playable AI shape.
- G4.2b [ ] Attribute/concept/recognition registries + per-person profiles
  ([v1] migration→codegen; needs minted migration numbers) and the
  users.id→persons mapping.
- G4.3 [x] (2026-10-21) Skill noise + level bands [FH]: LevelParams
  (perception delay ticks / kick angle+power error / decision jitter) per
  team; noise = PURE hash of (match_seed, tick, slot, channel) so brains
  stay pure and replays byte-identical; perception = linear backtrack (no
  history state); error scales by kick kind (short pass ½, drive 1, loft
  1¼); zero params = the baseline every earlier golden locks (hash grew
  the config fields — one re-lock). Bands u10→world via GAME_LEVEL_HOME/
  AWAY + GAME_MATCH_SEED (seeds finally vary matches). **Measured ladder,
  monotone: perfect 10 / world 19 / semipro 89 / amateur 182 goals per
  game; pro vs u10 ≈ 175–40.** Sandbox defaults world/world. Negative
  result recorded: naive fixed-lead interception made every level WORSE
  (perfect 10→394) — proper closing-speed interception is its own slice.
  Ordering note: G4.2b (per-person profiles) deferred until slots map to
  persons (team/lobby selection) — it had no consumer yet.
- G4.4 [x] (2026-10-21; closed by G4.14) Defense-as-structure + keeper hands +
  touch quality. James's two laws drove the slice: **"the thing that stops
  goals really is the bunching"** and **"the swarming of defense and the
  bunching of the offense is what stops goals."** Shipped mechanics:
  keeper hands (1.2 m reach, 2.2 m height, +6 m/s hands bonus, high-ball
  catch) + angle play + dive-lite (fast incoming ball → track its actual
  trajectory); touch quality (ball faster than your level's control speed
  bobbles off the first touch, ±60° noise deflection — receiving and
  intercepting degrade together); Shot action (18 m/s — 24 measured as
  uncatchable pinball, reverted) with far-corner placement away from the
  keeper; defensive SHAPE — compactness cap (no anchor >10 m upfield of
  the ball), back-line depth cover (track the deepest runner, no offside
  law yet), cover man (2nd-closest sits on the ball→goal line 7 m
  goal-side); and the swarm_pct level dial (the U-10 amoeba crowds its own
  attack AND barricades its goal — shape discipline IS a skill).
  **Measured ladder (mirrors, 90 min): perfect 0 / world 0.5 / semipro
  9.5 / amateur 26 / u10 58 goals per game.** Sandbox = semipro (3-4 and
  8-4 scorelines). The four items that were owed for this [x] — keeper
  reaction-time knob, interception closing-speed math, possession metric
  (flight → last-touch team), CI assertion bands — all landed in G4.14
  (§8.9).

### 8.6 G4.8 — the attack learns to run, and soccer reinvents offside

- Off-ball attack: run-in-behind by the most advanced disciplined
  attacker, back outlet (second support, 8 m goal-side) completing the
  triangle, over-the-top LoftedKick to a receiver beyond their last
  outfield line (§5.2's "sees the high line, plays over" — live).
- **The history ladder proved itself in the harness**: runs-in-behind
  instantly recreated 1860s goal-hanging (world 13→28 goals/game camping
  behind the line) — the exact problem the real offside law was invented
  for. So offside landed (charter amended, by measured need): flags armed
  per kick vs the second-last opponent + ball + halfway line, whistle on
  flagged first touch, dead-ball free kick, Offside match event (id 10).
- Then the SECOND emergent lesson: line-riding runners × man-tracking
  depth cover = a retreat spiral walking both lines into the goalmouth
  (0 offsides, goals UP). Fix: the back line HOLDS ≥ ball−25 m — which is
  what makes run timing a real problem (and the trap possible later).
- Keeper sweeping (free ball in the defensive third is the keeper's,
  hands and all) — gated as an ADVANCED concept (swarm < 40): two
  sweeping U-10 keepers measured a 97%-loose swamp and inverted the
  ladder. U-10 keepers stay rooted, as in life.
- Flat +5° shot difficulty on top of level error (1° finishing converted
  like penalties).
- Ladder as locked: u10 37 / u14 27 / amateur 26 / semipro ~27 / world 17
  (90-min mirrors) — endpoints right, middle compressed. The SYSTEMATIC
  parameter sweep via the harness (not sequential nudging) is the
  remaining G4.4 work, now with offside/tackle/sweep counters to target.

### 8.7 G4.9 — concepts become per-player, editable, fictional-rostered

- game/CONCEPTS.md: the knowledge taxonomy (10 wired concepts with bit
  ids + the build queue through team-tactics tier). James's standing
  instruction: MORE detail than FIFA/FM ever simulates — understanding is
  the product.
- Per-slot concept masks gate every knowledge branch in the Brain (the
  swarm>=40 team gate decomposed into per-player bits; band bundles
  reproduce prior behavior exactly — goldens unchanged).
- Wire 1.3: PLAYER_SETTINGS (0x33, admin) + ROSTER (0x34, names + masks).
  In-game EDIT mode: tap a player, tick his knowledge, APPLY — live.
- Fictional demo rosters (mig 628, James: real teams are a bad idea
  during dev): five teams filling the ladder — Lighthouse XI (world),
  Harbor Athletic (semipro), Sunday Albion (amateur, with 'Old Gio':
  full knowledge, 4.8 m/s legs), Tide U14, Minnows U10 (with 'Lily
  Park', the coached kid who marks while her team swarms). Per-player
  names + speeds + concept overrides from the DB; GAME_TEAM_HOME/AWAY
  select; roster band overrides level env. Verified live: drove "Karl
  Brandt", edited "Luis Serra" down to 8 concepts from the page.

### 8.8 G4.13 — presets become rows, identity becomes one tap

- Mig 630 (`game_style_presets` + `game_style_preset_ratings`): the
  auteur canon (CONCEPTS.md schools) + THE CLUB PRESET "Lighthouse" as
  DB rows — concept NAMES not bit ids (names survive bit growth), every
  Lighthouse rating citing its verbatim docs/game-model/ source line.
- Overlay semantics: a preset carries only the dials it names; applying
  it leaves unnamed concepts at their current rating (explicit 0 rows are
  meaningful — Sacchi zeroes man-mark). `applyPresetOverlay` in
  Levels.hpp, unit-tested.
- Wire 1.4: PRESETS (0x35, s→c catalog on connect — names only, id =
  index, vectors stay server-side) + APPLY_PRESET (0x36, c→s admin:
  `u8 team | u8 preset_id`) → fresh ROSTER. PROTOCOL.md 0x33/0x34 docs
  caught up to the graded form G4.11 shipped.
- Edit mode grew the preset bar: dropdown + → H / → A — a coach paints a
  team identity in one tap. DB down = no PRESETS frame, bar stays hidden;
  goldens untouched (presets only act when applied).

### 8.9 G4.14 — the sweep that found the keeper, G4.4 closed

The G4.11 grading had quietly INVERTED the ladder (measured at slice
start: pro 37 / world 30 / u10 30 goals per game) — three slices of
golden-gated work never noticed, which is exactly why the calibration CI
gate exists. Diagnosis was instrumentation, not nudging: the harness grew
possession-by-last-touch (the G4.1 metric gap, closed), shots + goal
anatomy (breakaway flag, scoring distance, PRE-TICK keeper geometry — the
Goal event fires after the kickoff reset and the first readings were
reset-state garbage), and dial-override args for no-recompile sweeps.

What the instruments found, in order:
- **Keepers were the whole inversion.** Beaten keepers measured 12-14 m
  off their line: the keeper block never `return`ed, so keepers fell
  through into the outfield counter-press/chase branches and hunted balls
  28 m upfield. The one-line fix (keepers do ONLY keeper things) took
  world 32 → 0.7 overnight. Supporting fixes: sweep gated on WINNABLE
  ("is it mine?" — keeper must beat the nearest opponent by 2 m), and the
  keeper's arrive radius cut 1.5 → 0.5 m (hands reach 1.2 m; the shared
  radius left a dead band where he stood watching the ball pass).
- **u14 keepers watched tricklers roll in**: a 14 m/s youth shot decays
  to ~7 m/s over 17 m of grass, arriving UNDER dive-lite's 12 m/s "is a
  shot" gate. The gate now asks "is it moving goalward" (4 m/s).
- **Keeper parry**: a beaten-control keeper's bobble was direction-
  preserving — u14 keepers deflected 23% of shots into their own net.
  Parries now always push away from goal.
- **Keeper reaction knob** (the owed G4.4 item): `keeper_reaction_ticks`
  per band — the keeper holds his angle-play spot for the first reaction
  ticks of a shot's flight. Physiological values (world 8 ticks ≈ 0.27 s
  … u10 18). Brain-side dial, deliberately NOT in the canonical hash.
- **Strike power is a skill**: shot speed caps at the band's
  control_speed + 6 (a U-10 "blast" is 12 m/s); kShotSpeed restored to
  24 m/s — above the 20 m/s outfield capture cap, so only keepers can
  handle a top-band strike. Placement aims 3.3 m inside the post.
- **Closing-speed interception** (the owed G4.3 negative-result redo):
  earliest-reach point on the ball's friction path, bounded 48-tick scan
  (can't aim past the catchable point, unlike the fixed-lead that
  measured worse). Ungated it re-broke the ladder both ways (u10 22,
  world 1.9), so it landed as concept bit 20 `intercept` — graded,
  per-second rolls, in the swarm<40 bundle.
- **Keeper distribution**: keepers never dribble out; open pass at ANY
  gain, else PUNT to the emptier wide midfield channel.

**Locked ladder (12-match 90-min mirrors, 2026-10-21): u10 12.7 /
u14 14.7 / amateur 9.1 / semipro 2.6 / pro 2.8 / world 2.2 /
perfect 0.8 goals/game** — first-ever realistic magnitudes (real-world
anchor 2.7; prior best had world at 17). u10/u14 are adjacent chaos
bands within noise of each other; the top three sit AT the anchor.
`test_calibration_bands` (ctest, ~25 s, 4-match samples) asserts the
ladder's SHAPE — u10 ∈ [6,25], amateur ∈ [4,16], world ∈ [0.5,6],
u10 > amateur > world, u10 ≥ 2×world — so the next silent inversion
fails the build instead of waiting three slices. AI goldens re-locked
(3v3 0x711f559f…, 11v11 0x694fffef…); zero-param determinism goldens
untouched.

### 8.10 G4.15 — teams wear their identity

Mig 631: `game_demo_teams.style_preset` names a mig-630 preset; the
daemon overlays it onto the team's ratings at boot and re-applies it
after every MATCH_SETTINGS band reset, so the identity survives level
changes. Lighthouse XI boots wearing "Lighthouse" — the club game model
(docs/game-model/) PLAYING, not just spec'd. Boot log names the worn
preset. No wire changes; the edit panel shows the overlaid ratings via
the ordinary ROSTER frame.

### v1 explicit non-goals (do not build before G4 closes)

Fouls/cards, stamina, substitutions-as-rule (subs arrive with G5 tactical
intents), weather, crowd, licensed anything, client-side prediction.
(Offside was on this list until G4.8, when the harness measured the exact
1860s goal-hanging problem the law exists to solve — amended by evidence.)

- **Docs live with the code and land in the same commit.** DESIGN.md and
  PROTOCOL.md are never allowed to lag the implementation; a slice that
  changes behavior updates the doc in the same slice.
- **In code:** every file opens with a purpose comment; every non-obvious
  mechanism states its constraint or reason, not its mechanics.
- **Credit the source of every technique**, in the file header or at the
  mechanism, using these tags (also used in DESIGN/PROTOCOL prose):

    the single level mechanism; drills-as-configs of one MatchScenario)
  - Public-domain algorithms are named plainly (e.g. FNV-1a hash).
- External code is never pasted in; techniques are learned and re-expressed
