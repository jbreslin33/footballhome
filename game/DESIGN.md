## 1. What this is

A server-authoritative 3D 11v11 soccer game, playable in a browser (and later
any client), with human control of one or more players and AI control of the
rest — built as a teaching tool for real tactical knowledge, from youth to
world-cup level, and open enough to also run as a management game
(Football-Manager-style: humans set tactics, AI plays) and to decompose into
small-sided scenarios (4v4, 2v1, coach-painted drills).

## 2. Pillars (every slice is judged against these)

1. **Open system.** The engine knows physics and perception. Everything that
   constitutes soccer knowledge — attributes, behaviors, formations, tactics,
   scenarios, rules flags, level bands, copy — is data: DB registry rows and
   parameterized components, changed by migration, never by engine edits.
2. **Server-authoritative.** All game state is computed server-side in C++.
   Clients send intents and render snapshots. Zero game logic client-side;
   client prediction/smoothing is cosmetic only.
3. **Deterministic fixed point.** No floats in the sim loop. Same seed + same
   inputs = byte-identical results across architectures, locked by replay
   goldens. This is what makes permanent refactoring safe.
4. **Protocol-first.** The versioned binary wire protocol (`game/PROTOCOL.md`)
   is the product boundary. Browser, native phone, desktop C++, and headless
   clients (calibration, AI stand-ins, spectator, replay) all interoperate by
   speaking it. Clients can be built by anyone, any time, without server
   changes.
5. **Realism by calibration, not vibes.** A headless calibration harness
   simulates batches of matches and asserts statistics against real-world
   anchors (~2.7 goals/game at top level, pass-completion % by level, shot
   counts, possession splits). Once live, those assertions are CI gates: a
   change that makes the game arcadey fails the build. Anti-FIFA by
   construction.

## 3. Non-negotiables (carried from v1 — decisions, not code)

- Gameplay math is fixed point; floats never enter the sim loop.
- Binary wire format; JSON only on human-facing debug surfaces.
- Every slice lands green: containerized test suite passes before commit.
- New registry attributes/concepts arrive by migration + regenerated header +
  consistency check against the live DB.
- Determinism goldens accumulate; a golden never silently changes value.
- **Slot-count agnosticism (new):** every component must work at any team
  size. A small-sided `MatchScenario` config (3v3) keeps its own determinism
  golden in CI from day one — if a feature only works at 22 slots, the build
  fails. This is what keeps 4v4/2v1/painted drills free forever.

## 4. Architecture

                              ┌─────▼─────┐
                              │ Postgres  │  ◀── meta layer (seasons,
                              └───────────┘      training, FM careers)
                                                 lives OUTSIDE the match
                                                 engine, same DB
```

- **3D scope:** the ball gets a z-axis (lofted passes, bounces, headers);
  player locomotion is planar. The browser client renders with WebGL
  (Three.js); fidelity is client-local dressing over the same authoritative
  positions.
- **Sim speed is a server parameter**, decoupled from wall clock: 1× live,
  N× fast-forward, headless max-speed. Required by the calibration harness
  and by manager mode; trivial under determinism.
- **Match lifecycle:** per-match daemons orchestrated like v1 (container per
  match, reaper), reachable via nginx WebSocket proxy with runtime DNS
  resolution (variable `proxy_pass` — the v1 pattern that resolves at request
  time, never startup).
- **Club integration (not optional — the point).** The game runs on the club
  app's own data: game profiles key on `persons.id` (your real squad are the
  characters, at their real levels); teams/rosters/formations are the club's
  existing rows; auth is the club's JWTs, so magic links drop a player into
  the game as themselves with zero signup (v1 proved this end to end). FM
  mode manages real club teams and fixtures; painted scenarios attach to a
  real person; training/attendance can feed attribute growth over time.

## 5. AI — three layers, hand-authored, data-driven

1. **Team layer** — tactic state (press high / mid-block / counter / hold),
   ball-relative formation targets (HELIOS-style interpolation: home position
   = f(formation, ball position)). Coaching knowledge lives here as DB rows.
2. **Role/unit layer** — responsibilities within the tactic: cover shadows,
   press partners, support spots, marking assignments, third-man runs.
3. **Player layer** — utility-scored behavior bags (v1's model), filtered by
   **skill-scaled perception/decision/execution noise**. Level (youth →
   world cup) = attribute distribution + noise scale. One knob, not twelve
   codepaths.

**No neural nets / RL for players** — opaque, non-deterministic,
unteachable. ML is permitted only offline: optimizing utility weights against
the calibration harness, with the resulting numbers committed as data.
Every decision must be inspectable ("jockey scored 0.8 because lateral
dribble + positioning_sense 72") — that inspectability IS the teaching tool.

## 6. Manager mode (FM-style) — day-one hooks, later milestone

The protocol defines **two intent classes from the start**: player intents
(move/pass/shoot/switch) and **tactical intents** (set formation, make sub,
change role instruction, set tactic state). A manager client is an ordinary
protocol speaker that only sends tactical intents and watches — at 1× or
fast-forwarded. A match with zero player-clients is AI vs AI, which is also
exactly what the calibration harness runs. The career meta-game (seasons,
transfers, training-driven attribute growth) is a separate layer over the
same DB registries and never touches the match engine.

## 7. Clients

- **v2.0 client: browser**, Three.js/WebGL, barebones polygon players.
  Phone-first: virtual joystick + pass/shoot/press buttons + tap-to-switch,
  broadcast-angle camera legible on a 6" screen. Touch controls and camera
  are named milestones, not afterthoughts.
- Snapshot budget ~15–25 KB/s (22 slots + 3D ball at 20–30 Hz) — fine on LTE.
- Later, without server changes: realistic desktop C++ client, native apps,
  WASM build of the fixed-point core for offline solo practice.

## 8. Milestones

| # | Adds | Exit gate (playability checkpoint) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **G0** | Protocol v1 handshake + intents/snapshots; fixed-point core (port Fixed64/FixedMath/TrigLUT concepts from v1); tick loop; WebSocket server; `make game-deploy` container test gate; Three.js client: pitch + one movable player | **You move a player around a 3D pitch from your phone.** Walking skeleton — every later slice lands inside it | not started |
| **G1** | 3D ball: dribble, ground pass, lofted kick, bounce; goal detection; first determinism goldens | **Kickabout**: dribble and shoot on a goal; two humans pass | not started |
| **G2** | Parameterized `MatchScenario`; formation anchoring; team possession state; utility-AI roles; calibration harness v0 (headless client, max-speed); standing 3v3 golden | **Playable 3v3 vs AI** — first real game | not started |
| **G3** | 22 slots; GK behaviors; restarts (kickoff, throw-in, goal-kick, corner — no offside/fouls); score/clock/halves; player switching | **Full 11v11 vs AI in the browser — THE PROTOTYPE** | not started |
| **G4** | Calibration CI gates live; level bands (youth→world cup) via attribute distributions + noise scaling; touch-control + camera polish | Realistic, level-aware 11v11 that fails CI if it goes arcadey | not started |
| **G5** | Manager mode v0: tactical intents live (subs, formation, tactic state); fast-forward; AI-vs-AI spectating | **Watch your lineup play your tactic, FM-style** | not started |
| **G6+** | Drills as `MatchScenario` configs (2v1, 4v2 press…); coach-painted scenarios; replay viewer; desktop client; WASM offline | Teaching library + client family | not started |

v1 shipped its first four milestones in ~17 days of sessions against a
15–20-week estimate; G0–G3 at that cadence is realistically a few weeks of
sessions. Slices get specced per-milestone as work opens (v1 style: numbered
slices, exit gates, goldens).

### 8.1 G0 slices

- G0.1 [x] (2026-10-21) Scaffolding + fixed-point math core **adopted verbatim from v1
  after review** (`Fixed64`, `FixedMath`, `TrigLUT`, `RngDet`, `Vec3` + their
  golden tests — knowledge-free, dimension-agnostic infrastructure; adopting
  a vetted library is not carrying old architecture). `game/CMakeLists.txt`,
  tests green on host. Landed: namespace `fh::game::math`, 5/5 ctests passed
  (fixed64, fixed_math, trig_lut, rng_det, vec3) on g++ 13 / CMake 3.28.
- G0.2 [ ] Tick loop + match clock + world skeleton (one entity integrating
  a move intent) + canonical state hash + **first determinism golden**.
- G0.3 [ ] Protocol framing: envelope codec, HELLO/GOODBYE, PLAYER_INTENT,
  SNAPSHOT encode/decode with unit tests. The same slice locks §2/§4/§6
  layouts in PROTOCOL.md (doc change lands with the code, v1 style).
- G0.4 [ ] WebSocket server (v1 handshake/transport patterns re-reviewed, not
  blind-ported), JWT auth via the club secret, single-match daemon binary +
  Dockerfile.
- G0.5 [ ] `make game-deploy`: container image build + full ctest suite
  inside the image = the standing green gate.
- G0.6 [ ] nginx `/game/<key>` proxy (variable upstream, request-time DNS) +
  compose service — the one club-stack touchpoint; coordinated deploy.
- G0.7 [ ] Browser client: Three.js pitch + player, snapshot interpolation,
  virtual joystick + keyboard, `game.html`.
- G0.8 [ ] Exit gate: **move a player around a 3D pitch from a phone over
  prod TLS**; determinism golden re-verified; G0 close-out ticked here.

### v1 explicit non-goals (do not build before G4 closes)

Offside, fouls/cards, stamina, substitutions-as-rule (subs arrive with G5
tactical intents), weather, crowd, licensed anything, client-side prediction.
